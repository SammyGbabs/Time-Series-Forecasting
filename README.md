# Time-Series-Forecasting

# PM2.5 Air Quality Prediction Model

## Overview
Air pollution, particularly PM2.5, poses a significant threat to public health, urban planning, and the environment. By accurately predicting PM2.5 concentrations, governments, and communities can take timely action to mitigate the harmful effects of air pollution.

This project focuses on predicting PM2.5 concentrations in Beijing using historical air quality and weather data. The project involves preprocessing sequential data, designing and training Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) or Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) models, and fine-tuning the model to achieve optimal performance.

The objective is to be at the top of the leaderboard by improving the model through multiple experiments and adjustments.

## Instructions for Reproducing Results

### 1. Download the Datasets
You will need two datasets for this project:
- **Training Dataset**: Located in the `data/` folder (`Time-Series-Forecasting/data/train.csv`).
- **Test Dataset**: Located in the `data/` folder (`Time-Series-Forecasting/data/test.csv`).

Download the datasets and place them in the `data/` folder.

### 2. Open the Notebook
The full workflow for preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and saving the model is contained in the Jupyter/Colab notebook, which is located in the `notebook/` folder (`Time-Series-Forecasting/notebok/`).

To open the notebook:
- You can either **download the notebook** and run it locally using Jupyter, or
- **Open it in Google Colab** by clicking the link provided in the notebook file itself.

### 3. Make a Copy of the Notebook (Mandatory)
If using Google Colab:
- **Save a copy to your Drive** before making any changes. To do this, go to `File → Save a copy in Drive` in the Colab menu. This way, you can make edits while preserving the original notebook intact.

### 4. Upload the Dataset
- **Option 1**: Upload the `train.csv` and `test.csv` datasets directly to the file browser in Google Colab.
- **Option 2**: Upload the datasets to your **Google Drive** and mount your Drive in Colab. Instructions for mounting your Google Drive are available in the second code cell of the notebook.

### 5. Run the Code
Execute the notebook step by step. The following tasks will be performed:
- **Preprocessing the Data**: The data will be cleaned and formatted for training.
- **Model Training**: An RNN or LSTM model will be trained on the preprocessed data.
- **Evaluation**: The model's performance will be evaluated on the test set.
- **Saving the Model**: The trained model will be saved for future use.

### 6. Experiment and Fine-Tune
Feel free to experiment with different:
- **Hyperparameters**: Adjust parameters such as learning rate, batch size, number of epochs, etc.
- **Model Architectures**: You can try various architectures like deeper LSTMs or GRUs (Gated Recurrent Units) to improve performance.
- **Feature Engineering**: Explore different ways to preprocess and enhance the dataset.

### 7. Leaderboard Performance
The goal is to continually improve the model's accuracy by experimenting with different strategies and contributing to achieving top leaderboard status.

## Suggestions for Improvement

- **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Try adjusting the number of layers, hidden units, or learning rates.
- **Model Architectures**: Experiment with variations of RNN, GRU, or LSTM models.
- **Cross-Validation**: Use cross-validation techniques to better evaluate the model performance.
- **Feature Selection**: Investigate which features have the most impact on the model’s predictions.
